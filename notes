use inst.sh
don't know why cudnn doesn't install
    it does but /usr/local/cuda/lib64 is a link to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
    and it somehow filters only those from cuda??? black magic
    have LD_LIBRARY_PATH point there

for a in /sys/bus/pci/devices/*; do echo 0 | sudo tee -a $a/numa_node; done

install tf with pip
use apt to get cuda and cudnn
dl cudnn with correct version and move to get library?
also add the lib to env in bashrc
something like that
